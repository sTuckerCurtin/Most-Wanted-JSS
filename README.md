Main Stories

<!-- 
(5 points): As a developer, I want to make at least 15 consistent commits with good, descriptive messages. -->
<!-- (10 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for people based on a single trait -->
<!-- You should be able to find and display a list of people who match the search in an alert -->
<!-- (10 points): As a user, I want to be able to look up someone’s information after I find them with the program (displaying the person's full information). -->
<!-- (15 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s immediate family members, displaying the names of the family members and their relation to the found person. -->
<!-- Immediate family include spouse, parents, and siblings -->
(15 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the names of the descendants).
Descendants include children, childrens children, and so on.
<!-- (15 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on multiple traits (up to a maximum of five criteria at once).
For example, if you search for the eye color of  blue, you should get back a list of people who have the eye color of blue. Then, you should be prompted if you would like to further filter down the results by other traits until one of the following scenarios:
Only one person is in the results
The results have no matches -->
The user no longer wants to continue filtering down the results.
(5 points): As a developer, I want to run validation on any user input, ensuring that a user is re-prompted when they provide invalid input. (Can utilize the built in validatedPrompt function)

Bonus Stories
(5 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants using recursion.
